> While Retail Stride appears to speak to both brands and retailers, the primary audience is brands. Most brand visitors will arrive after direct outreach inviting them to partner with us as an authorized distributor. The core pitch is: “Allow us to purchase your products at distributor terms so we can supply independent brick-and-mortar retailers you’re not currently reaching.”
