# Multi-Domain Brand Strategy Overview  
*(Retail Stride Distribution Network — November 2025)*

---

## 1. Purpose  
To strengthen vertical credibility and improve outreach conversion across specialized brand categories, the Retail Stride network now operates under a **multi-domain brand architecture**. Each domain retains unified compliance, onboarding, and MAP enforcement standards while communicating directly to its respective industry vertical with tailored positioning.

## 2. Core Framework  
All domains share a single backend infrastructure:
- Central CRM, Postmark, and Cloud Run integration  
- Shared retailer verification and compliance pipeline  
- Unified MAP & Channel Policy and Retailer Agreement  
- Domain-aligned email sending and landing pages for trust and deliverability  

Each sub-brand inherits Retail Stride’s core values:  
**Authorized. Reliable. Protected.**
