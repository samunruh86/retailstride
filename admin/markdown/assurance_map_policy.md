### **1. Purpose**
All Retail Stride partners agree to uphold this MAP & Channel Policy as a condition of their participation. Retail Stride monitors and enforces compliance through automated and manual reviews to deliver a consistent, trusted experience for every brand we represent.

---

### **2. Scope**
**This policy applies to all:**
- Retailers and resellers within the Retail Stride verified network
- Marketing and sales channels representing Retail Stride products
- Digital listings, advertisements, and promotional materials for partner brands

Compliance with these standards is required for ongoing access to Retail Stride distribution and support services.

---

### **3. MAP Standards**
Each brand partner defines its own Minimum Advertised Price (MAP). Retail Stride enforces every brand’s policy across our network to ensure MAP integrity is maintained.

**Key Principles**
- No partner may advertise below a brand’s published MAP.
- MAP applies to all public-facing media, including websites, email, ads, and print.
- Pricing displayed in cart or after login may differ only when explicitly permitted by the brand’s policy.
- Temporary promotions, bundles, or incentive offers require written approval from the brand or Retail Stride compliance team.

Violations of MAP may lead to suspension or permanent removal from the Retail Stride network.

---

### **4. Channel Restrictions**
To protect brand presentation and channel integrity across every sale, Retail Stride partners must adhere to the following restrictions:
- Redistribution on open third-party marketplaces (including Amazon, Walmart, eBay, and Facebook Marketplace) is prohibited without written authorization.
- Approved retailers may sell only through their owned storefronts and official websites.
- Products may not be resold, wholesaled, or transferred to unauthorized third parties.
- Brand trademarks, photography, and descriptions are permitted solely in approved retail environments.

Retail Stride enforces these standards via internal audits, purchase traceability, and network monitoring.

---

### **5. Enforcement & Compliance**
Retail Stride reserves the right to investigate potential violations at any time. We may request proof of compliance, suspend or terminate access for non-compliance, and notify brand partners when policy breaches are confirmed.

Repeat or deliberate violations may result in permanent exclusion from the Retail Stride network.

---

### **6. Reporting & Support**
Retailers and brand partners can report suspected violations or request clarification directly with the Retail Stride compliance team.
