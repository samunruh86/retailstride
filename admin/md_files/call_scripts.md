# **Direct Phone Call Scripts**

> *Note: These are conversation flows, not scripts to read verbatim. The goal is to internalize the structure and value propositions, then speak naturally and adapt to each conversation.*

---

### **Core Principles**
- **Build Rapport First:** Start with light, genuine conversation. People buy from people — connect before pitching.  
- **Be Human:** Don’t sound robotic or rehearsed. Flow naturally while keeping these talking points in mind.  
- **Stay Flexible:** Every call will be different; listen actively and pivot based on what the other person says.
